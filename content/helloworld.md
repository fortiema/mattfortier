Hello guys! This is my new page, resurrected from the old mattfortier.com. Unfortunately had to move domain as the price for the .com was a bit too steep for my taste, but I digress.

I'm Matt, a 20-something Big Data Engineer from Montreal, Canada currently living near Shanghai, China working for PatSnap, a SaaS data company that has for mission to disrupt the Innovation industry. It's now been well over 2 years since I first set foot in this wild and completely different Universe. I think I've had my fair share of experiences, both good and bad.

I've recently felt the urge to share more about my journey and these experiences, as well as the usual technical ramblings. Let's see where this takes us...
