Title: About

I'm a 20-something big data engineer from Montreal, Canada now living near Shanghai, China.
I am currently working for [PatSnap](http://patsnap.com/), a SaaS company disrupting the innovation industry.

I dab in machine learning, data science and natural language processing to extract meaningful information from enormous amount of text data in multiple languages, and I also design robust and scalable data processing pipelines and APIs. I am constantly on the lookout for new techniques and best practices to improve my craft.

My tools of choice? Python, Jupyter, MongoDB, ElasticSearch and AWS.
