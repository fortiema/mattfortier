Title: About

I'm a 20-something data engineer and AI solution architect from Montreal, Canada. Travelled around for work. Lived and worked in China for 3 years. I am currently at [Keatext](http://keatext.ai/), a SaaS company that uses advanced AI/NLP to bring serious value to the Customer Experience/Satisfacion world, where I lead the ai dev team.

I dab in artificial intelligence, data science and natural language processing to extract meaningful information from enormous amount of text data in multiple languages. I love designing robust and scalable data-intensive backends that make full use of AI in a scalable, distributed and resilient end-to-end solution. I am constantly on the lookout for new techniques and best practices to improve my craft.

I'm also a certified AWS Solutions Architect.

My weapons of choice? Python, Jupyter, Keras, MongoDB, ElasticSearch and AWS.
